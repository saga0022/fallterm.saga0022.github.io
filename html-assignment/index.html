        <p>
            I am a <em>Filipino</em> born from the country of the Philippines on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of February 1997. I am the youngest of the three siblings in my family and we migrated here in Canada a couple of years ago. I love visiting musuems here in Ottawa especially the <abbr title="National Gallery of Canada">NGC</abbr> and would love to visit more musuems soon. I love going out during fall season.

            People who know me would describe me as a person who does lettering and art. I am an aspiring letterer and graphic designer and currently studying <em>Interactive Media Design
            </em> at Algonquin College. Making crafts, drawing letters and calligraphy is my passion that is why I love making handmade gifts to my loved ones. But on a side note, I love plants and watching movies.
